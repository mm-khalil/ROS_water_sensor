# ROS_water_sensor
ROS_Serial_Arduino water sensor interface.

In ROS:
Its not a magic to control Arduino or write code in Arduino IDE and it is basically a ROS code,

So in this code I uses a water sensor to detect/check a water/rain/level of water by using any sensor, itâ€™s a generic code so you can use any of sensor and link ROS with Arduino IDE and some hardware to implement this code any check water/rain/level.
